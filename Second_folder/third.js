import React from "react";

export default function third() {
  return <div>third</div>;
}

// This code is a React component that returns a div with the text "third" inside it.
// It is a simple functional component that can be used in a React application.
// The component is exported as the default export of the module, which means it can be imported and used in other files.
// The component does not take any props or have any state, making it a stateless functional component.
// It is a common pattern in React to create components that are reusable and can be composed together to build complex user interfaces.
// The component can be used in a React application by importing it and including it in the JSX of another component or in the main application file.
// The component can also be styled using CSS or inline styles to customize its appearance.
// Overall, this code is a simple example of a React component that can be used in a larger application to display content on the screen.
// The component can be further enhanced by adding props, state, and event handlers to make it more dynamic and interactive.
// The component can also be tested using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure its functionality and correctness.
